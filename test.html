<!--

The task is to use an external api, fetch the information, display the results on both a map and as a simple card.
** "google" will be bound to the window and will be accessible to use their maps api and geocoding


1. We will be using https://randomuser.me/ the url is provided in the main controller to get a couple of user profiles.
2. Show these profiles in a simple box, with email, first name, last name, and picture
3. Using the profiles' location, geocode the address to get its lat-lon
4. With the lat-lon display markers on a map corresponding to their location



Extra credit:
- making the card look nice
- have it be responsive to mobile
- add interactions (i.e. hover the card, will make the corresponding marker jump)
- use components and additional files
